# scripts

These scripts are ones that I have written and use on my system.
All dependencies are annotated in the script.

* `align-window` resizes and moves the currently focused X11 window so that it aligns perfectly within a 40px by 40px grid
* `dmenu-power` provides a simple powermenu via dmenu
