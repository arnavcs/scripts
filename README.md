# scripts

## Installation

To install any script, simply add it to the path.
An easy way to do this is explained in my system dotfiles [here](https://github.com/arnavcs/dotfiles).

All dependencies are annotated at the start of every script.

## Usage

* `window-align` resizes and moves the currently focused X11 window so that it aligns perfectly within a 40px by 40px grid
* `window-redraw` allows the user to draw a rectangle to describe the desired window geometry
* `power-menu` provides a simple power menu via dmenu with suspend, reboot, and poweroff options
* `display-layout` allows the user to run one of the scripts stored in `~/.screenlayout/` to configure the X11 display setup
