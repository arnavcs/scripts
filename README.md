# scripts

I have written these scripts for use with my system whose dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/arnavcs/dotfiles).

To install any script, simply add it to the path. An easy way to do this is explained in the dotfiles repository's `README.md`.
All dependencies are annotated in the script.

* `align-window` resizes and moves the currently focused X11 window so that it aligns perfectly within a 40px by 40px grid
* `dmenu-power` provides a simple powermenu via dmenu
