# scripts

## Installation

To install any script, simply add it to the path.
An easy way to do this is explained in my system dotfiles [here](https://github.com/arnavcs/dotfiles).

All dependencies are annotated at the start of every script.

## Usage

* `align-window` resizes and moves the currently focused X11 window so that it aligns perfectly within a 40px by 40px grid
* `dmenu-power` provides a simple powermenu via dmenu
